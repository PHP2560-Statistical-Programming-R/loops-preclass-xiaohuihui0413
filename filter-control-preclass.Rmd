### Question 1:

Using a loop, print the integers from 1 to 50. 

```{r}
for(i in 1:50){print(i)}
```


### Question 2:

A.  Using a loop, add all the integers between 0 and 1000.

```{r}
a=0
for(i in 1:1000){a=a+i}
a
```


B. Now, add all the EVEN integers between 0 and 1000 (hint: use seq())

```{r}
b<-seq(from=0,to=1000,by=2)
x=0
for(i in 1:501){x=x+b[i]}
x
```


C. Now, repeat A and B WITHOUT using a loop.

```{r}
c<-seq(from=0,to=1000,by=2)
sum(c)
```

### Question 3:

Here is a dataframe of survey data containing 5 questions :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
survey <- data.frame(
                     "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                     "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                     "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                     "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                     "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                     )
```
The response to each question should be an integer between 1 and 5. Obviously, we have some bad values in the dataframe. The goal of this problem is to fix them.

A. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called survey.clean where all the invalid values (those that are not integers between 1 and 5) are set to NA.

```{r}
survey <- data.frame(
                     "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                     "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                     "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                     "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                     "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                     )
for(j in 2:6){for(i in 1:6){if(survey[i,j]<1|survey[i,j]>5){survey[i,j]<-NA}
  }
}
survey
```


B. Now, again using a loop, add a new column to the dataframe called “invalid.answers” that indicates, for each participant, how many bad answers they gave.

```{r}
for(i in 1:6){survey$invalid.answers[i]<-sum(is.na(survey[i,]))}
survey
```
